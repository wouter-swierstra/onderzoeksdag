<h3>Abstracts</h3>
                
<h4>Algorithmic Flowers - Han Hoogeveen</h4>

<p>In this talk I will discuss a problem that plays an important role
in the flower industry: we must determine how many mother plants are
required to be able to produce a given demand of cuttings. This sounds
like an easy problem, but working with living material (plants)
introduces complications that are rarely encountered in optimization
problems: the constraints for cutting such that the mother plant
remains in shape are not explicitly known.</p>

<p>We have tackled this problem by a combination of data mining and linear
programming. We apply data mining to infer constraints that a cutting
pattern, stating how many cuttings to harvest in each period, should obey,
and we use these constraints in a linear programming formulation that
determines the minimum number of mother plants necessary. We then consider
the problem of maximizing the total profit given the number of mother plants
and show how to solve it through linear programming.</p>

<h4>Domain-specific Type Error Diagnosis - Jurriaan Hage</h4>

<p>Domain-specific languages (DSLs) are (often restricted) programming
languages suited for a particular domain.  In software technology and
industry they have become increasingly popular because programs in the
given domain can be extremely concise and clear, and can often be
written by domain-experts who are not trained programmers.</p>

<p>To avoid the effort of developing a tool chain (a compiler, an IDE,
and libraries) for every DSL, and to ease the integration of multiple
DSLs, an alternative way of implementing DSLs is to embed them in a
suitably powerful general purpose language, like C++ or Haskell. In
that case, a DSL is often simply a library that exhibits the
``fluency’’ of the domain and that is encoded in some way in the
general purpose language.</p>

<p>The complication that I address in this talk is how to manipulate
the type error messages that are given by the compiler, so that they
are phrased in terms of the domain the programmer understands without
revealing the underlying encoding that a programmer should not have to
know about.</p>

<h4>Exceptional Model Mining - Ad Feelders</h4>

<p>Exceptional Model Mining (EMM) is an exploratory data mining
technique that has been developed in recent years in collaboration
between Leiden and Utrecht. We explain the general idea of EMM and
illustrate its application through examples.</p>

<h4>Music Information Retrieval: integrating musical information from multiple sources - Vincent Koops</h4>

<p>In this talk, we present our current research on the fundamental issue
of integrating heterogeneous information from multiple, autonomous
data sources using data fusion, and its application in Music
Information Retrieval. The recent explosion of crowd-sourced
information, such as on the internet, calls for sophisticated
algorithms for data-driven quality assessment and data integration to
create better, and more reliable data.  In Music Information
Retrieval, a typical application scenario are chord label sequences.
We present our approach to integrate heterogeneous chord label
sequences using data fusion, in order to create significantly better
chord label sequences, demonstrating our ongoing collaboration with
Chordify, an online music e-learning platform. The Chordify website
teaches users the chords needed to play along with music from websites
such as YouTube. Chords are a compact way to describe the harmony of a
musical piece, and sequences of chords are often used by guitarists
and pianists to play a piece. Chordify allows users to create their
own, personalized chord sequences for a song if they disagree with the
output of the Chordify automatic chord extraction algorithm. Due to
the many users of Chordify, this results in large amounts of
crowd-sourced musical information. We demonstrate how we can integrate
these heterogeneous chord label sequences using data fusion, to create
significantly better chord label sequences. Since data fusion is a
very generic approach, we also show how we apply it to improving the
state assurance in machine state prediction from audio sources for the
specific case of quadcopters, in an ongoing collaboration with
Carnegie Mellon University. Furthermore, we show our current research
aiming to model the musical preference of a large group of Chordify
users. Using deep learning, we try to move from a normative to a more
descriptive automatic chord extraction method.</p>

<h4>SleepCare: persuasive strategies in e-coaching for insomnia</h4>

<p>Improving assignment adherence is a major challenge in all types of
behavior therapies (BT), in particular in self-help therapies from
books and internet sites. In the Sleepcare-project, methods from
persuasive technology were investigated to improve adherence of
self-help BT for insomnia (BT-i). The project aimed at a generic
coaching system that integrates persuasive strategies with protocols
for behavior change in BT-i, and the technology that supports the
system. The interface is based on the so-called Talk-and-Tools
metaphor where a clear distinction is made between conversational
interaction (‘Talk’)and direct manipulation (‘Tools’). BT-i protocols
and persuasive strategies, such as notification and commitment, were
implemented in a fully automated smartphone application and integrated
in a research infrastructure for empirical testing. In this
presentation, I will give a brief overview of the development of the
system, the rationale behind its design, some preliminary results from
a Randomized Control Trial and our future plans.</p>


<h4>Directional Field Synthesis, Design, and Processing</h4>

<p>Directional fields on discrete surfaces and in volumes are
key components of geometry processing. Many applications make use of
such fields, among which are remeshing, surface parametrization
(texture mapping), texture synthesis, fluid simulation, and many
more. I will present the challenges and the limitations in the design
and the analysis of such fields, and focus on novel ways to compute
them.</p>
